# ARKit-Workout

This project is my contribution  to the project of an iOS Developer.
The code I have written is about viewing the instantaneous position of an object (ship in the app) in the radar view with respect to camera's point of view. There are similar apps in the App Store that have similar logic like Ghost Detector. 
For people who don't know, you need physical device to run or to view application. ARkit apps don't work with simulator.
